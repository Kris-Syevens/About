# *** Python Data Types ***

# Built-in Data Types
# In programming, data type is an important concept.

# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

# Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

# Text Type:	    str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	    dict
# Set Types:	    set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	    bool
# Binary Types:	    bytes, bytearray, memoryview
# None Type:	    NoneType

# To check the type of a variable or object, you can use the type() method.

a = "Kris" # String
b = 2 # Int
c = 2.0 # Float
d = 2j # Complex


print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
